# Project-1-Tic-Tac-Toe
I developed a web and app based game of Tic Tac Toe using html, css and javascript. The game features a user interface and a game logic that enable two players to mark X or O symbols on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game keeps score and shows a message when the game ends.
